## Readme - App

You want to read a book or maybe write a story but don't know how to start? That's what Readme is for! Readme will help you read and listen to short stories quickly, so that you can create your own story and listen to how it sounds.

This app was developed as my capstone project during the final four weeks of the neuefische Web Development Bootcamp in Munich, Germany.

This app is optimized for mobile usage, so please switch your browser to responsive mode (iPhone SE / XR).
